# Ilan's Working Directory

This repo contains all the code used for plume analysis.


### output_csvs
The output_csvs folder contains te outputs generated by label_copy.py in which the data is processed and filtered using a threshold.
The threshold is specified in the name of the csv file e.g. a threshold value of Mean and 3 Standard Deviations will be m3sd. 
For fixed values of the threshold, the file is saved as thx, i.e. threshold of x.

### output_imgs
Here is where the plots generated will be saved. The name of the image is specified as follows:
thrshold_windowsize_feature_filter.pdf

This output is specific for the read_and_roll.py output, where we are calculating rolling windows for different features of the output csvs generated by label_copy.py
